  Given a hinged DOF, we need to knock out the rows and columns
  associated with that DOF in the element stiffness matrix.  We also
  need to adjust all the coefficients in that stiffness matrix
  according to:
 
  a(i,j) += [-a(m,j)/a(m,m)]*a(i,m)
 
  where m is the row number of the hinged DOF.  The downside to this
  procedure is that we will _not_ be able to get displacements at this
  DOF.  In general, the end displacements of elements connected at a
  hinged DOF will not be continuous.  Given the way FElt deals with
  displacements (i.e., as a solution), I figured it was a better
  compromise to put as much of this in as I could without completely
  changing the output paradigm (i.e., I don't want to start outputting
  element end displacement in lieu of or in addition to the global
  displacements that we already calculate.)
